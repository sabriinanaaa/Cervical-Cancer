This project focused on developing an improved model for accurately classifying cervix types using cervical images from a Cervical Cancer dataset from Kaggle. 
The project introduced ColpoNet2.0, which integrates features from previous classification models such as ResNet-50, DenseNet, and GoogLeNet. 
The upgraded model achieved a commendable 72% accuracy over approximately 300 epochs, representing a 7% improvement over its predecessor. 
To further enhance performance, I implemented the automatic remove image (ARI) technique and applied a 3x3 Laplacian kernel to calculate sharpening parameters of image responses. 
This approach effectively filtered out noisy and low-quality images captured by MobileODTâ€™s handheld colposcopes, resulting in an accuracy of 78% within fewer than 300 epochs. 
This project served as a catalyst for my deeper exploration into the realm of medical imaging.
