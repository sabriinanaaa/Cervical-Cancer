# Image Recognition Classification of Cervical Cancer Precursors Using the ColpoNet Deep Learning Network

This project aimed to develop an enhanced model for accurately classifying cervix types using cervical images from a Cervical Cancer dataset sourced from Kaggle. ColpoNet2.0 was introduced, integrating features from ResNet-50, DenseNet, and GoogLeNet models. The upgraded model achieved a commendable 72% accuracy over approximately 300 epochs, marking a 7% improvement over its predecessor. Further performance enhancement was achieved by implementing the automatic remove image (ARI) technique and applying a 3x3 Laplacian kernel to sharpen image responses. This filtering approach effectively removed noisy and low-quality images captured by MobileODTâ€™s handheld colposcopes, yielding an accuracy of 78% within fewer than 300 epochs. This project served as a catalyst for a deeper exploration into medical imaging.

Moreover, this research project aimed to develop the optimal model for screening cervical cancer precursors using deep learning techniques. The dataset utilized was sourced from competitions initiated by Intel and MobileODT on Kaggle, comprising historical images of cervical cancer precursors. It included 1481 training images, 512 testing images, and an additional 4633 images. Various deep learning models were compared, and the technical features of existing models were integrated to propose the Collaborative post-processing network diagnostic method, ColpoNet. The clinical objective was to utilize images for the prevention and diagnosis of cervical cancer precursors, aiming to improve screening efficiency and reduce costs significantly. Rapid classification through imaging can aid in quick diagnosis, which is more comprehensive and accurate compared to traditional cervical smears, facilitating auxiliary diagnosis. Ultimately, the project aims to assist women in unstable environments in effectively preventing cervical cancer, thereby reducing its incidence and mortality rates.
